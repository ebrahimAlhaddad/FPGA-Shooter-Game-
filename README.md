# FPGA-Shooter-Game-
The design uses rgb scanning to display objects on an external monitor connected to the FPGA via VGA. The game displays
a shooter, which can be controlled by left and right buttons on the FPGA (input ports may need adjustment depending on
FPGA model). Three rows of targets appear at the top of the screen and move in varying speed. Score is counted and displayed
on the FPGA's SSD display
